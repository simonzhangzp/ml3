* Your team has been hired by a client to produce a series of tree-based predictive models to identify customers who are likely to leave the company. Models must be  Classification Tree models, Bagging models, Random Forest models ,and Boosting models.
* Each team is to submit their "best" model in each of these four modeling categories, and they must identify which of these models is their single "best of the best."
* To identify the three "winners", the client has withheld 1,000 observations. Each team's "best of the best" model will be used to predict churn outcomes for these 1,000 observations. Model quality will be judged based on overall error rate of these predictions.
